## Identity Traps

“There are three musts,” Ellis wrote, “which hold us back: 
1. I must do well. 
2. You must treat me well. 
3. And the world must be easy.”

“You’re in the Identity Trap if you feign an interest in the environment to prove your civic interest, or give to the poor to prove you’re not selfish, or study dull subjects to appear to be ‘intellectual.’

All of my relationships have benefited from this mindset shift, from my marriage to my career. Trying to re-educate the other person is the source of nearly all conflict in relationships. Without such a quixotic crusade, my relationships have become serenely simple; it’s all about enjoying the other person’s company and/or profiting from their freely-given cooperation

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
And wisdom to know the difference.

> Living free is having that wisdom.

It is granting yourself the serenity that comes with the acceptance of a basic fact: that you cannot ultimately control what others do or how they think of you. It is making room in your soul for the courage to unreservedly tackle the one thing you can fundamentally change for the better: your own life.

You’re free if you want to be.
