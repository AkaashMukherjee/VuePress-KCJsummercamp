1. Define a Super Hero - ( give atributes to a character )
2. Invent a story where the super-hero saves someone
3. Pass the ball-untangle chors. Each person tells a part of the story and remembers
4. We go backwards to the beginning

::: tip
When we untangled the web, was it easy to remember the different steps our hero took?

Who are some real-life heroes who took many steps to reach their achievements?

In your own life, what is a goal that you can break into smaller parts?
