# ALGORITHMS

> A set of steps is called an algorithm. The steps need to be clear, specific and in the correct order. When we make algorithms, some common instructions (commands) we can use are:

1. Loops: A loop is an instruction that tells the computer to repeat a set of steps. For example, “Print the name of every child on the list” instead of “Print the first child’s name. Print the second child’s name.”

2. Conditionals: An algorithm needs to give instructions for every possible situation. For example, if the algorithm only says to direct the cars to the left and the bikes to the right, the person or computer following the instructions will not know what to do when a motorcycle arrives.
