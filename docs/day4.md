# DAY 4: The treasure hunt

With the help of technology and an old amnesiac pirate, the crew finds Barbe Bleu's treasure before he does.

## 1. Introductory unplugged activity

### Draw a treasure map (inpired by RTP Unseen Structure)

1) The crew members have to find the map to the treasure based on the instructions from an old amnesiac pirate. 
2) Once they find where the map is located (in a dark cave) the group is divided into two teams. 
3) Every team sends a scout to check the map in the cave. The scout has only 3 seconds to look at the map and help his team reproduce the map correctly. (We light the cave with a candle for few seconds)
4) Once every kid has gone to the cave and the map is complete, the two teams compare their maps.

## 2. Microbit activity 

- Check the radio distance WIP
- One MicroBit with radio to find the are where the treasure is found - General
- One MicroBit that will detect the with magnetism exact location - Concrete

## 3. The treasure detector (inspired by Hot-Cold)

The crew programs their microbit to send radio signals of various strenghts so their microbit can be used as a range finder. With the help of their map and their special treasure detector, they can now hunt down the treasure.

1) One team is sent to find the key and the other is sent to find the treasure chest.
2) The range finder produces a sound which freqency increases with decreasing distance from the target. 
3) Once the team is very close to the target, they switch detection mode to detect the exact location of the target using a amgnetic field detector.
