## 1. Introductory unplugged activity

> INDOORS and OUTDOORS

The space will be divided in two (or three) areas, each with a theme, for example:
1. The relaxation area
2. The working space
3. The place to keep the treasure

In the center there is pile of objects to distribute in the different thematic areas. (we will need lots of elements, cussion, chairs, strings, branches...)

1) Create two (or three) teams, one for each thematic area
2) Create two (or three) categories of objects and ask the group to decide what object belongs where
3) In each team, Architects are designated to draw a plan of were every object should go in the area. For younger kids condisder giving the plan already made.
4) In the meantime the remaining members of the team, the Builders, go outside to pick up decoration materials

Members of the crew program a microbit that detects magnetic fields and emit sound and light.
They can use it as a special fish finder to catch their dinner more efficiently. 

Material:
* A blanket to act as the see surface
* Cardboard fishies with magnets attached to them

4) The goal is for the Fisherman to catch the fish with the help of the explorer
