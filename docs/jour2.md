## Introductory unplugged activity 

### Build your pirate lair (inspired by RTP Architect) 
> INDOORS and OUTDOORS

In the Center we have a big pile of objects to build the spaces.
( we will need lots of elements, cussion, chairs, strings, branches...)

- Create two teams one for each space
- Create two category piles
- Architects draw the Plan Older/Younger we give an already made plan
- Builders go outside to pick up decoration materials
- Architects give precise instructions to build the camps

## Microbit activity

### It is time to go fishing

Members of the crew program a microbit that detects magnetic fields and emit sound. 
They can use it as a special fish finder to catch their dinner more efficiently. 

Material:
* A blanket to act as the see surface
* Cardboard fishies with magnets attached to them
* Fishing poles with a magnet attached to the string 

- One Explorer with MicroBit to find the Fish ( sound + light )
- Random sound generator to finds fish or shark
- One that fishes with a fishing rod
- The rest of the members sustain the fishing surface
