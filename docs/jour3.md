# DAY 3 - Pirates Training Bootcamp

A pirate has to understand what value means and how to preserve it.

## 1. Introductory unplugged activity 

### Find precious goods (inspired by RTP Secret Mission)

The captain asks the crew to bring back precious goods but does not tell exactly what he is looking for. 
He rejects or accepts objects based on a certain pattern the crew members have to discover.

Examples of pattern: 
- Things of red / blue
- Things of wood /  metal / rocks
- Things light / heavyig, big / small
- Worked by men or not, artificial / natural

> Create a small competition: The first who finds the Pattern wins Points

## 2. Microbit activity

### Proper treasure handling

Items in a treasure are often very fragile. The crew members have to write a microbit program to detect if a treasure item has been miss-handled using the gyroscope readings. They pratice extreme treasure handling in a obstacle course.

1) The program displays to information from the gyro with images and sound (use only x axis)
2) The microbit is attached to the Chest carrier
3) We divided in two groups
4) Kids transport the chest in the obstacle course two by two, each holding to one side of the chest
5) The mirobit is attach to the chest and a soun is emitted if the tilt angle is over a certain value.
6) Points are given to each team: points to be the first. Points are removed for each improper handling event.

- Tresor transport to the other side
- We have points to arrive + points to be the first - points of extreme chest handling

### Materiel
- USB Mouses!!!
- Build two Chest carrier
- Adjust different tilt sensibilities
