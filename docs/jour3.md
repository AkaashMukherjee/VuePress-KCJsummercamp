A pirate has to understand what value means and how to preserve it.

=====

## Introductory unplugged activity 

### Find precious goods (inspired by RTP Secret Mission)

The captain asks the crew to bring back precious goods but does not tell exactly what he is looking for. 
He rejects or accepts objects based on a certain pattern the crew members have to discover.

Examples: 
- Things of red / blue
- Things of wood /  metal / rocks
- Things light / heavyig, big / small
- Worked by men or not, artificial / natural

> Create a small competition: The first who finds the Pattern wins Points

## Microbit activity

### Proper treasure handling

Items in a treasure are often very fragile. The crew members have to write a microbit program to detect if a treasure item has been miss-handled using the gyroscope readings. They pratice extreme treasure handling in a obstacle course.

- We program the Gyro with images and sound
- We control the tilt in one axe ( x ) 
- The microbit is attached to the Chest carrier
- We count the times the we go over a certain angle

### Obstacles Race with transporting the treasure chest

- Two groups
- Tresor transport to the other side
- We have points to arrive + points to be the first - points of extreme chest handling

### Materiel

- USB Mouses!!!
- Build two Chest carrier
- Adjust different tilt sensibilities
