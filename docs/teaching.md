# Our teaching approach to the Micro:bit in summer camps

Summer camps particularities:

- Kids are there to have fun: they want to play
- Age groups are less uniform
- Many kids come because they like computers

Our approach: take the code out

On hardware: The fact that we use the MI-POWER backplate for mictobit did help a lot. This add-on powers the microbit with a 3V battery and provides an ON/OFF switch and a speaker. It gave us a new world of possibilities and make working with the microbits much easier. We highly recommend to addapt all the Microbits with these plates when going to classes. Just the fact of having the tiny speakers doubles the practical usability of the unit for the classes. Since we had some problems with MI-POWER backplates (battery hold break, frequent battery replacement, etc.) we recommend trying to find a different product. The Power:bit from Elecfreaks seams a very good product.
