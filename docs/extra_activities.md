## The Avatar game

In Jame's Cameron movie Avatar (2009), humans control Na'vi giant clones of themselves with technology. In this activity, the kids are the humans and they get to control their parents, who are the Na'vis, with microbits. They then play a Na'vi soccer game.

Participants create two simple microbit programs that interact with each other with the on board wifi radio. One microbit serves as a remote control for the kids and the other displays instructions to the avatars.

## Flash light tag

The light emitting diodes (LEDs) on the microbit emit light when an electrical current flows through them. The can also work in reverse and generate an electrical current when enlightened. They LED array can therefore be used as a light detector. 

Using this feature, participants write a microbit program that increments a counter by one when enlightened. Each participant then were there microbit on the arm with an elastic band. The game is a variant of the river crossing game.
