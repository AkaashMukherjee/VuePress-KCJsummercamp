# DAY 4 - The treasure hunt

With the help of technology and an old amnesiac pirate, the crew finds Barbe Bleu's treasure before he does.

## 1. Introductory unplugged activity

### Draw a treasure map (inpired by RTP Unseen Structure)

The crew members have to draw a map to the treasure based on the instructions from an old amnesiac pirate. They then validate if their map is correct by sending a scout to Barbe Bleu's lair. The scout has only 3 seconds to look at the map and help his team correct the errors.

- The pirate does not remember where is the card
- One member has to find the map in a dark cave
- We light the cave with a candle for few seconds
- They transmit what they have seen to their peers
- All of them will go to make sure the map is well described
- Finnally we compare the maps of both teams

## 2. Microbit\Picobit activity 

- Check the radio distance WIP

## 3. The treasure detector (inspired by Hot-Cold)

The crew programs their microbit to send radio signals of various strenghts so their microbit can be used as a range finder. With the help of their map and their special treasure detector, they can now hunt down the treasure.
