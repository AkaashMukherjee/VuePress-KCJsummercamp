# DAY 5: The final battle

It is well known that pirates like to fight just for fun.

## 1. Introductory unplugged activity

### Build an unbreakable treasure chest

There is a lot to do to get ready for the battle. First the team has to build an unbreakable treasure chest that looks awesome and that contains the heart of their captain.

## 2. Microbit\Picobit activity

### Add technological security features to your treasure chest

The treasure chest can be opened only if every team member puts in his/her coin. The chest is also equiped with an alarm system that warns the team if it has been opened. The team has to write two different microbit programs to achieve these functionnality.

1. A coin counter for opening the chest
2. An alarm system to detect the opening of the chest

## 3. The final battle: a complex capture the flag type of game

The final battle is in three stages:

1. During a special kind of tag, the other team can steal the coins from their opponents
2. They then go to the other teams' chest and puts in the stolen coins until the treasure chest is unlocked
3. Once a treasure chest is unlocked, the attackers can now steal the heart of their opponents' captain and they have to bring it back to their base without droping it. The attackers cannot run with the heart, they have to pass it to each other. The defenders have to try by all means to intercept the stolen heart. 

The winner of the round is the team that successfully brings the captain's heart back to their base. The round is a draw if the heart is successfully intercepted by the defenders or if it is dropped.
